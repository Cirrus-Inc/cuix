# Getting started

How an app adopts cuix, start to finish. Ten minutes for a Vite or Next app that already
runs Tailwind v4. The reference page is `playground/` in this repo: it does every step below.

## 0. Prerequisites

- Tailwind **v4**. An app on v3 upgrades first.
- React 19 if you want the components. Tokens alone need nothing.

## 1. Install

```sh
npm i @cirrus/cuix@github:Cirrus-Inc/cuix#v0.10.1
npm i react react-dom lucide-react @radix-ui/react-slot @radix-ui/react-dialog @radix-ui/react-tooltip @radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu @radix-ui/react-popover @radix-ui/react-select   # React peers
npm i -D eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y                              # lint peer
npm i @fontsource-variable/inter                             # the font; `geist` too if you use the `data` type role
```

In `package.json` that is `"@cirrus/cuix": "github:Cirrus-Inc/cuix#v0.10.1"`. Pin a tag, never a branch. Upgrades are deliberate: bump the tag, re-run `install-gates.sh`, run your gates.

The pin is a GitHub dependency, so npm shells out to `git`. A Docker builder stage must install it
first: `node:alpine` ships without it (`apk add --no-cache git`).

**Monorepo.** `npm i -w <workspace> @cirrus/cuix@github:...#tag` can nest cuix under the workspace's
`node_modules` instead of hoisting it (seen with npm 11.18.0). Every root-relative path then breaks:
a hand-written `@source`, `install-gates.sh --src`, tests. Install from the repo root, or run `ls node_modules/@cirrus/cuix`
after the install and check it landed where those paths expect.

## 2. CSS

```css
/* app.css */
@import "tailwindcss";
@import "@cirrus/cuix/tokens.css";   /* custom properties: eight themes, type, spacing, focus, motion */
@import "@cirrus/cuix/theme.css";    /* Tailwind v4 @theme: bg-surface, text-body, rounded-control, min-h-target … */
@import "@fontsource-variable/inter";
```

Order matters: `tokens.css` before `theme.css`. `theme.css` also declares `@source "./react"`
(relative to itself), so Tailwind finds the component classes wherever the package is installed.
Only an app that vendors `dist/react` somewhere else adds its own `@source` for that copy.

## 3. `<head>`

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover" />
<meta name="theme-color" content="#ffffff" />
```

The pre-paint script `@cirrus/cuix/theme-init.js` must run inline, first in `<head>`, before any CSS. It
is what stops a stored dark theme from flashing light on load; `ThemeProvider` keeps `theme-color`
in step after that. Never `maximum-scale` or `user-scalable=no`.

**Vite.** Inject the shipped file at build time, so it can never go stale:

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { readFileSync } from "node:fs";
import { createRequire } from "node:module";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";

const themeInit = () => ({
  name: "cuix-theme-init",
  transformIndexHtml: () => [{
    tag: "script",
    children: readFileSync(createRequire(import.meta.url).resolve("@cirrus/cuix/theme-init.js"), "utf8"),
    injectTo: "head-prepend" as const,
  }],
});

export default defineConfig({ plugins: [themeInit()] });
```

`head-prepend` makes it the first child of `<head>` in `vite build` output.

**Other stacks.** Paste the contents of `node_modules/@cirrus/cuix/dist/theme-init.js` into an inline
`<script>` at the top of `<head>`. The script hard-codes the theme list, so a theme added in a later
tag is invisible to your copy until you re-paste it: re-paste on every upgrade.

**CSP.** An inline script is blocked by a `script-src` without a hash or nonce. `@cirrus/cuix/theme-init.sha256`
(`node_modules/@cirrus/cuix/dist/theme-init.sha256`) holds the ready-made token:

```
script-src 'self' 'sha256-…';   # the single line in theme-init.sha256, quoted, without its newline
```

The hash covers the exact bytes of `theme-init.js`, including its single trailing newline (it equals
`openssl dgst -sha256 -binary dist/theme-init.js | base64`). The Vite recipe emits those bytes
unchanged. A hand-pasted copy must also match byte for byte, newline included, or the browser
rejects it; with a nonce-based CSP, put the nonce on the tag instead. Inline the file byte-exact:
no `trim()`, no formatter pass, or the hash differs and the CSP blocks the script.

## 4. React root

> **Warning:** `ThemeProvider` must wrap the whole app, unauthenticated pages (login, signup, errors) included.

```tsx
import {
  AppShell, IconProvider, ThemeProvider, ThemeSwitcher, THEME_NAMES, ToastProvider, TooltipProvider,
} from "@cirrus/cuix/react";

createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!).render(
  <ThemeProvider legacy={{ key: "app-theme" }} /* optional: migrates an old key once */>
    <IconProvider>
      <TooltipProvider>
        <ToastProvider>
          <AppShell
            header={<><Logo /><ThemeSwitcher themes={THEME_NAMES} className="ml-auto" /></>}
            sidebar={<Nav />}
          >
            <Routes />
          </AppShell>
        </ToastProvider>
      </TooltipProvider>
    </IconProvider>
  </ThemeProvider>,
);
```

- `AppShell` gives you the skip link, the `<header>` / `<main id="main">` landmarks and safe
  areas. Keep your own navigation inside it; cuix ships primitives, not shells.
- `ThemeSwitcher` without `themes` offers the default pair plus System. Pass `THEME_NAMES` for all eight.
  An app that pins one theme sets `data-theme` on `<html>` and mounts no switcher.
- Each route calls `useDocumentTitle("Contacts", "Acme")`.

Mount all four providers, in this order (the playground does). `TooltipProvider` and
`ToastProvider` are easy to forget, and the harness never shows it because the playground mounts them. Missing:

| Missing | Result |
|---|---|
| `TooltipProvider` | `Tooltip` throws on render: Radix "`Tooltip` must be used within `TooltipProvider`" |
| `ToastProvider` | `useToast()` and `useToastLog()` throw: "must be used inside `<ToastProvider>`" |
| `ThemeProvider` | `useTheme()` and `ThemeSwitcher` throw: "must be used inside `<ThemeProvider>`" |
| `IconProvider` | icons lose the shared 16px / 1.75 stroke defaults |

### New product checklist

Decide before the first screen:

- Which themes the product offers (all eight via `THEME_NAMES`, or a subset in `ThemeSwitcher themes`).
- A switcher, or one pinned theme: set `data-theme` on `<html>` and mount no switcher.
- Gates installed (section 7) and run in CI.
- An axe pass in every theme you offer in CI (section 8).

## 5. Build screens

Use the utilities `theme.css` defines and nothing else for appearance:

| Need | Write | Never |
|---|---|---|
| Canvas, card, input well | `bg-background`, `bg-surface`, `bg-surface-raised` | `bg-white`, `bg-slate-50`, a hex |
| Text | `text-foreground`, `text-foreground-muted`, `text-foreground-subtle` | `text-gray-500`, opacity on text |
| Control edge | `border-border-strong` | `border-border` on an input (decorative only, fails 3:1) |
| Tinted badge or chip | `bg-accent-soft text-accent-on-soft` | `bg-accent/10` behind text |
| Type | `text-display` … `text-body` … `text-label` | `text-sm` with its own `leading-*` |
| Size of anything clickable | `min-h-target min-w-target` (44px) | `h-8`, `size-icon` |
| Corners | `rounded-control`, `rounded-card`, `rounded-pill` (switch tracks, avatars only) | `rounded-md`, `rounded-full` on a chip |
| Layers, motion | `z-modal`, `duration-base ease-cuix` | `z-[999]`, `duration-200` |

Status never travels by colour alone (icon or word with it). Helper text ≤90 characters.
Full token reference: [tokens.md](./tokens.md). Component contracts: [components.md](./components.md).
Copy rules: [copy.md](./copy.md).

App-only colours (pipeline states, an `onair` indicator) go in the app's own file as
namespaced custom properties (`--app-*`), authored for every theme the app offers, with their own
contrast test. cuix never learns them.

## 6. Lint

```js
// eslint.config.js
import cuixA11y from "@cirrus/cuix/eslint";
export default [...cuixA11y /*, your config */];
```

## 7. Gates

```sh
bash node_modules/@cirrus/cuix/scripts/install-gates.sh --src src        # add --ui <dir> if you keep your own primitives
npm run check:gates
```

In a monorepo, check `ls node_modules/@cirrus/cuix` first: a nested install breaks the path (see section 1).

Copies the three gates into `scripts/`, freezes today's drift counts as the baseline and adds
`check:gates` to `package.json`. Commit it and run it in CI. Re-run after each cuix upgrade.
Details: [gates.md](./gates.md).

## 8. CI

- Run your own axe / Playwright pass in every theme you offer. cuix guarantees its components in
  all eight; your layouts are yours.

## 9. Without React, or inside a shadow root

| Case | Import | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Plain page, any framework | `tokens.css` + `theme.css` (if Tailwind) | `data-theme` on `<html>` as above |
| UI inside a shadow root (e.g. an embedded studio) | `tokens.host.css` | Every token on `:host`, no base rules. `data-theme` on the shadow host; bring your own `:focus-visible` rule (copy the one in `tokens.md` → Focus) |
| A lightweight embed snippet | `tokens.embed.css` | 16 tokens, default pair only, follows the host OS, never persists; `--cuix-embed-accent` is the one host override |

## 10. Upgrading

Bump the tag. Breaking changes are token renames and removals; the old name is kept as a
hand-written alias for one minor first. Read the tag's notes, run your gates, done.
